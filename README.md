# Exploratory Data Analysis on US Accidents Dataset

## Description
This project aims to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis on the US Accidents dataset, which contains countrywide traffic accident data from 49 states of the USA, spanning from February 2016 to December 2021. The dataset includes various features such as accident severity, location, weather conditions, and traffic signals, among others.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "US Accidents" dataset, which can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

The dataset comprises approximately 2.8 million accident records and 47 columns, including features like accident severity, start time, location coordinates, weather conditions, and the presence of nearby amenities or traffic signals.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, fixing incorrect data types, and removing unnecessary columns.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform comprehensive EDA to gain insights into the dataset, including visualizations, statistical summaries, and identifying patterns and trends.
3. **Feature Analysis**: Analyze the impact of various features, such as weather conditions, visibility, traffic signals, and location, on the severity and occurrence of accidents.
4. **Geographical Analysis**: Explore the geographical distribution of accidents across different states and cities, identifying potential hotspots or areas with higher accident rates.
5. **Temporal Analysis**: Investigate the temporal patterns of accidents, including hourly, daily, and monthly trends, to understand the influence of time on accident occurrence.
6. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the correlations between different features and accident severity to identify potential relationships and contributing factors.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code in this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
